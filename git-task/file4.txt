everytime you come to mind, i realize i'm smiling. 
for short, do not remember every detail, every mood.
if we believe that true love never has to end, then we must know that we will love again.
my heart is wherever you are.
look into my eyes - you will see what you mean to me. 
all or nothing, now or never.
